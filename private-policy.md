# Privacy Policy for TCG Timer
**Last Updated: June 21, 2025**

Thank you for using TCG Timer ("the App"), a Roku application. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle information when you use my App.

My core philosophy is to respect your privacy and to collect as little information as possible. *(I'm REALLY not interested in your information)*

**1. Information I Collect**
The TCG Timer app is designed to be simple and private. I do not collect any personally identifiable information from you. *(nobody likes that)*

- **Personal Information:** I do not require you to create an account, nor do I collect or request your name, email address, physical address, or any other personal details. *(again, this information is useless to me)*
- **Usage Data and Analytics:** I do not use any analytics tools to track your behavior, log your usage patterns, or monitor how you interact with the App. *(I don't have time to look over that kind of stuff)*
- **Advertising:** i do not display advertisements, and therefore I do not use any advertising identifiers. *(nobody likes that either)*

The only information the App stores on your device is the IP address and port number of the TCG Timer server that it needs to connect to for its basic functionality. This information is not related to you or your device's unique identity.

**2. How I Use Your Information**
Since I do not collect any personal information, I do not use it for any purpose. The server IP address and port stored by the App are used exclusively to establish a connection and ensure the timer functions as intended.

**3. Information Sharing and Disclosure**
I do not have any of your personal information to share or sell. I will not share the non-personal technical data (the server IP address) with any third parties. *(it's not transmitted to me in any way)*

**4. Data Security**
While no data transmission over the internet or LAN is 100% secure, I'm committed to protecting your privacy. The App operates without collecting personal data, which is the best form of security. Any data stored locally on the app (the server IP and port) is for core functionality only.

**5. Children's Privacy**
My App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since I do not collect any personal information in the first place, I believe my App is safe for all ages.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I make any changes, I will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed. Your continued use of the App constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.

**7. Contact Me**
